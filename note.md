1. What is Big O in coding (scalability of code)

- number of operations & elements is linear, more elements -> more operations, linear time
- dont care abt how deep is the line in graph, care abt how the line move when input increase
- Big O rule:

* Worst case
* Remove constants : ex O(101 + 5n + 1) -> O(n + 1) -> O(n), O(n/2) -> O(n)
* Different terms for inputs
* Drop Non Dominants
